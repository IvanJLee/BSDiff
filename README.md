This a Demo for Android incremental update. We use BSDiff to generate the patch file then BSPatch to generate the new apk.

we use WeChat apk files to do the test. The old file is WeChat 6.3.25 and the new one is WeChat 6.3.27.

To run this demo, you need to put all the apk included in the 'apk' folder of this repository files in your Android device SDCard root path.

If you run this Demo successfully, you will find a new file named 'weixin_new.apk' in your Android Device's root SDCard path. 
This file should be the same with the file named 'weixin6327android880.apk'.
